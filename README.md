# OWASP Juice shop Security Assessment
This project presents a web application vulnerability assessment of OWASP Juice Shop, an intentionally insecure platform designed for security training and testing. The assessment was conducted during a cybersecurity internship to gain hands-on experience in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating common web application vulnerabilities.

🔍 Tools & Methodology

Burp suite was utilized for automated scanning, spidering, and active testing.

Both automated and manual testing were performed to confirm findings and understand their potential impact.

Vulnerabilities were classified according to the OWASP Top 10 categories.
